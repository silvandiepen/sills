# SEO Audit

Determine whether search engines can discover, understand, select, and present the intended public content.

## Non-negotiable contract

- Do not modify application code, content, configuration, dependencies, lockfiles, generated files, data, or repository structure.
- Create files only inside the selected dated audit directory.
- Suggestions and verification steps are allowed; fixes are not.
- Never invent evidence, selectors, source locations, standards, measurements, screenshots, traces, runtime behaviour, field data, or user research.
- Distinguish direct observation, automated detection, documentation, inference, and manual-review requirements.
- Include concrete positive findings. Do not manufacture praise.
- Read project documentation and repository instructions before applying general practice.
- A clean automated result is not proof of quality, compliance, security, readiness, or absence of defects.


## Supported modes

- `source`: repository inspection only.
- `runtime`: running product inspection only.
- `full`: combine source and runtime evidence.
- `changed`: focus on a branch, commit, or pull-request diff and affected areas.
- `ci`: non-interactive execution with machine-readable output.
- `verify`: retest findings from an earlier report without changing the product.

Depth is independent: `quick`, `standard`, or `deep`. Default to `full` and `standard` when possible.


## Before auditing

1. Read repository instructions, product documentation, requirements, decisions, prior audits, and domain-specific guidance.
2. Determine the project type, platforms, environments, roles, intended users, runtime availability, and safe test boundaries.
3. Build a coverage inventory before selecting representative workflows, states, modules, services, or routes.
4. Prefer existing tools and evidence. Run additional tooling only in isolation and never alter the audited project.
5. Redact secrets and personal data from reports and evidence.

## Output

Default to `audit/YYYY-MM-DD/`; use `-02`, `-03`, and so on for repeated runs on the same date.

Write the shared Sills files plus the specialist report under `reports/`. Every finding must include category, kind, title, severity when applicable, release-blocker status, confidence, origin, scope, impact, evidence or manual-review reason, reproduction when relevant, expected and observed results, recommendation, and verification instructions.

Use the specialist finding prefix documented below. Human-readable and structured reports must agree.


- Specialist report: `reports/seo.md`
- Finding IDs: `SEO-0001`, `SEO-0002`, and so on.

## Audit procedure

1. Identify which surfaces are intentionally public, private, indexable, canonical, regional, or temporary.
2. Crawl or inventory representative routes and compare source, server response, rendered DOM, and declared signals.
3. Inspect status codes, redirects, canonicals, robots rules, sitemaps, links, metadata, structured data, and international alternates.
4. Find duplicate, orphaned, thin, contradictory, inaccessible, or JavaScript-dependent content.
5. Review migrations and URL stability when routes or domains changed.
6. Separate technical defects from content opportunities and avoid promising rankings.
7. Record evidence-backed positive findings, limitations, and untested areas.
8. Write the specialist report, structured findings, and remediation handoff.
9. Validate that no file outside the audit directory changed.

## Severity and confidence

- Severity: `critical`, `major`, `moderate`, `minor`, `observation`.
- Confidence: `confirmed`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `requires-manual-verification`.
- `releaseBlocker` is a separate boolean.

Do not produce a single artificial overall score. Prefer finding counts, blockers, coverage, measured values where meaningful, and category assessments such as `strong`, `acceptable`, `needs work`, or `critical`.

## References

Read only the references relevant to the discovered scope:

- `references/methodology.md`
- `references/checklist.md`
- `references/evidence-and-reporting.md`
- `references/platforms-and-tools.md`

## Shared report and runtime-intake contract

Before writing any SEO audit output, read `references/report-contract.md` and use the bundled report template.

- Begin with a professional status conclusion using the universal Sills health level and an audit-specific label.
- Report the relevant status dimensions rather than hiding materially different strengths and weaknesses behind one label.
- Include a ship decision only when this specialist has enough evidence to justify one.
- Include a prioritised Tasks section with traceable actions, acceptance criteria, and verification.
- Keep the standard section order so every Sills report is immediately comparable.
- When runtime web coverage is relevant and no usable URL is supplied or documented, ask once for live, staging, preview, or local URLs and their environment and role. Continue source analysis if none are provided.
- In CI mode, never prompt; record absent runtime targets as a limitation.

Recommended status dimensions: Crawlability; Indexability; Metadata and structured data; Content and internal linking; Performance and rendering.
